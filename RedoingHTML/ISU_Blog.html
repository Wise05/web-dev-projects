    <h1>My First Semester at ISU</h1>

            <p>This website is for me to refresh my use of HTML/CSS and use javascript! Don't mind the source code because it will probably be a huge mess by the time I am finished writing this page since I don't have much experience building a website. But that's okay! I simply will do my best and try to learn from this experience as I go. Since this project is meant to help me learn. Anyway, lets look at what I have planned for each part of this single page website.</p>
            <p>In the first part of this webpage I am going to try and create a slide show of some of the images that I took on my phone with a caption explaining what they are. This will require some javascript, which should be pretty simple. The next part will be a reflection on my classes. Next will be an overview of some of the things that I have coded this semester, including class and personal projects. And then the final part will be my conclusion. </p>
            <p>I am aiming to make this webpage shrinkable and have it still look good. Which will probably be the most difficult part. However, I wouldn't be learning anything if I didn't challenge myself!</p>

                <p>This is an image of the giant wooden gnome that I got to see in Rieman gardens. This was during the Destination Iowa State event which was meant to bring together new freshmen.</p>
